This is a straightforward and rather na√Øve implementation of a [Blueprints](http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com/)-enabled graph over [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/).

Blueprints is a database-agnostic library for handling graphs. Blueredis allows you to run Blueprints on top of redis. Also see [Pipes](http://pipes.tinkerpop.com/) and [Gremlin](http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com/) to see what this integration will also allow you to do.

Running
===

Requires Redis 2.x compatible version of [JRedis](http://github.com/alphazero/jredis) (git clone this repo, and you'll get a jar)


    Graph db = new RedisGraph();
    
    String password = "pass";
    Graph db1 = new RedisGraph(password);

    String host = "127.0.0.1";
    int port = 6379;
    Graph db2 = new RedisGraph(host, port);

    int database = 10;
    Graph db3 = new RedisGraph(host, port, pass, database);

After this you work with the database as with any Blueprints-enabled graph.

Peculiarities
===

ID creation
---

RedisGraph **handles id creation for you**. Any id parameter passed to addVertex/addEdge will be ignored. All ids are of type long

Serializing properties
---

**By default all properties are saved and retrieved as strings**, regardless of the type of object you pass to `addVertex`. If you want to save actual objects/values, call `graph.serializeProperties(true)`. Note though, that it uses Base64 encoding on top of Java serialization so it may take up a lot of space.

Transactions
---

Currently **transactions are not supported**

Indexing
===

Blueredis implements an index for both vertex and edge properties. This implementation is based on [A fast, fuzzy, full-text index using Redis](http://playnice.ly/blog/2010/05/05/a-fast-fuzzy-full-text-index-using-redis/). 

Turning indexing off
---

**By default indexing is on**. To turn it off, call `graph.setIndexing(false)`. To turn it back on, call `graph.setIndexing(true)`.

Implementing your own
---

You may wish to implement your own indexing service. To do this:

* implement Blueprints' `Index` interface
* make sure that your service's constructor accepts an instance of `RedisGraph`
* call `graph.setIndexing(true, serviceInstance)` and pass an instance of your service to it

Implementation
===

Vertices
---

Each vertex is represented by the following keys:

* `vertex:ID`, vertex id. This one is used to test if a vertex exists
* `vertex:ID:properties`, a hash of all vertex properties
* `vertex:ID:edges:in`, a set of all incoming edges
* `vertex:ID:edges:out`, a set of all outgoing edges

Edges
---

Each edge is represented by the following keys:

* `edge:ID`, edge id. This one is used to test if an edge exists
* `edge:ID:label`, a string containing the edge's label
* `edge:ID:in`, index of "in" vertex
* `edge:ID:out`, index of "out" vertex
* `edge:ID:properties`, a hash of all edge properties

Globals
---

This are just some keys that hold values necessary for Blueredis to work:

* `globals:next_vertex_id`, a counter that's incremented each time a new vertex is added
* `globals:next_edge_id`, a counter that's incremented each time a new edge is added
* `globals:vertices`, a sorted list of all vertex ids
* `globals:edges`, a sorted list of all edge ids

Tests
===

RedisGraph now passes tinkerpop's tests (these are included with the source).


Benchmarks
===

Benchmarks can be found here: [benchmarks page in wiki](http://github.com/dmitriid/blueredis/wiki). Note that reeds seems performs better under load than during singular requests.
